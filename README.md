## Bashrail Starter Template

[![Build Status][cci_build_status_badge]][cci_build_status]

Originally forked from an [older demonstration][] of [@dgleba][]'s [Bashrail][] utility.

Go [**here**](https://bashrail-starter.herokuapp.com/) to see a live demo of a production deployment.

### Includes

- PostgreSQL driver setup. You can either [use a local instance][] or [connect a Docker image][]
- Docker and Docker Compose scripts. Containers are mostly deployment-ready, but [some configuration][] is required
- A custom web font added to the [Rails asset pipeline][]
- CI pipeline with automated [Heroku][] deployment

#### Important

Don't forget to [generate a `SECRET_KEY_BASE`][] token before deploying in production mode.

For most environments, it should be as simple as running:

    EDITOR=vim RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rails credentials:edit

and saving the generated file as `config/secrets.yml`.

If successful, the output will resemble the following:

    Adding config/master.key to store the master encryption key: <xxxxxxxxxxxxxx>

    Save this in a password manager your team can access.

    If you lose the key, no one, including you, can access anything encrypted with it.

#### Additional Setup (*optional*)

##### From the original [index.html.erb](https://github.com/dgleba/brail484b46/blob/master/app/views/home/index.html.erb)

###### JWT

The example below is how to make a curl HTTP request with the proper authentication headers.

Be sure to actually use a working route and not `http://localhost:3001/products.json`

```erb
<% if user_signed_in? %>
  curl -i -X  GET --header 'Authorization: Bearer <%= JWTWrapper.encode({ user_id: current_user.id }) %>' 'http://localhost:3001/products.json'
<% end %>
```
